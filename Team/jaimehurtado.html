                    <p>Jaime A. Hurtado was born 23 October 1982. A native of Colombia, South America, he came to the
                        United States at the age of 12. He completed his studies in New York and graduated from the High
                        School of Arts and Business in Queens, NY in 2001. After graduating, he joined the Marine Corps
                        where he completed 4 years of honorable service.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During his time in the Marines, Jaime served as an infantry team leader, conducting missions in
                        various parts of the world including Kosovo, U.A.E, Kenya, Djibouti, Macedonia, Kuwait, and
                        Iraq. After completing his service, Jaime found himself unable to adjust back to a normal life,
                        battling with PTSD, homelessness, and unemployment in New York. Jaime decided to move to
                        Tallahassee, Florida, where he met his wife in 2008.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019 Jaime was given the opportunity to learn SCUBA diving, something that has helped him
                        tremendously with his PTSD and chronic back pain. He is very thankful that he was chosen as a
                        recipient of Buck's Scholarship and cannot wait to see what other opportunities this program may
                        bring.

                        Jaime now lives in Crawfordville, Florida, with his wife and stepson. His stepdaughter Camila
                        lives in Tallahassee where she attends TCC and works at Southern Fidelity Insurance. Jaime
                        currently works as assistant service director for a property management company, his wife Andrea
                        works as the administrative assistant for the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco. His
                        stepson Anthony attends Florida State University School where he is a wrestler and Football
                        player. SCUBA diving for Jaime has been a dream come true as well as therapy for the way he
                        struggles with PTSD, he would love to share his story with other veterans and help them overcome
                        those struggles as well.
