                                <p class="lead">People with disabilities can often enjoy SCUBA diving despite any
                                    physical limitations.
                                    Following medical clearance by your doctor, you will learn to experience diving
                                    regardless of your
                                    different abilities. Water is invigorating and healing...don't let anyone (except
                                    your doctor) tell
                                    you that you can't dive, too! Dr. Gabrielle K. Gabrielli has been an HSA instructor
                                    since 2011 (HSA
                                    certification number 4606), and she loves working with people with disabilities and
                                    helping teach others
                                    to do the same in a safe, respectful, and fun way.</p>

                having disabilities. In the U.S. alone, this translates to millions of people, many of whom are
                fully capable of becoming SCUBA divers. Our open water training programs for people with
                disabilities are taught with a high margin of safety because we use teaching techniques developed
                with over 20 years of research and feedback. Students with disabilities are trained and certified
                according to HSA Physical Performance Standards and a multilevel certification system so exacting
                and sensitive that it enables us to train people with a wide range of disabilities including
                paraplegia, quadriplegia, blindness, and those with high-functioning brain injuries or mild
                retardation. We base our students’ diving proficiencies on their abilities to assist another diver
                in the water. For instance, if you are a Level A diver, you are certified to dive with one other
                person; a Level B diver must dive with two other able-bodied divers, and a Level C diver not only
                requires two dive buddies, but one must be trained in diver rescue. The third member of the buddy
                team is not there to further assist the B or C Level diver but rather to ensure the safety of the A
                Level or above diver that cannot be assisted by the B or C Level diver. HSA Level B or C divers are
                certified as recreational SCUBA divers and do not have any sport diving restrictions. Also unique to
                our training system is Marine Life Identification. Our Open Water SCUBA Diver course requires that
                one marine life form be described and identified on each of the students’ five certifying SCUBA
                dives.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Many of us know a friend or family member we'd like to involve in SCUBA diving. Or,
                we'd welcome the challenge of learning about disabilities, accessibility issues, and how to dive with
                people who have disabilities. The HSA "Dive Buddy Program" offers able-bodied divers this opportunity to
                expand their underwater world to include sharing it with a buddy with disabilities. An HSA certified
                Dive Buddy receives nearly as much information and skill training as an instructor, except the training
                focuses on recreation, not instruction.</p>
