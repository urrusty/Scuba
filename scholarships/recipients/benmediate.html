                        <p class="text-center">Congratulations to Benjamin Mediate for being the 3rd recipient of Buck's
                            Scholarship! Ben was born 13 November 1990 and is native to the Tallahassee, Florida region,
                            but he has also lived in and around Chicago, Illinois and San Diego, California. He
                            experienced intermittent homelessness with his mom in Chicago between the ages of 3 and 8
                            and again at age 16. He dropped out of school, received his GED, and moved out when he was
                            16. After that, his grandparents took him in and unofficially adopted him. Ben started
                            working various jobs and going to college at night. Unfortunately, with the belief that
                            higher education was for those outside of his societal stature, and with lack of
                            self-confidence, he was not focused and was unsuccessful in college at that time.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">At age 19, Ben met his future wife. He worked odd jobs for a year and
                            realized his desire to become a U.S. Marine would be a fleeting memory full of regret if he
                            did not join soon. He joined and was shipped off Parris Island 21 May 2012 with a Marine
                            Reconnaissance contract. In 2013 he deployed to Bahrain while assisting in the efforts to
                            conduct missions nightly in Iraq and Syria against ISIS as an Aviation Ordnance Technician
                            for the F/A 18. His unit also worked directly with SEAL team 3 in Djibouti, and with French
                            troops in Jordan. He was in the first unit since the 80s to take out a tank as well as an
                            ISIS training camp. After deployment, he became a combat coach but developed medical
                            complications with his lungs due to chemical exposure overseas. This eventually led to his
                            medical separation in June 2016.</p>

                        <p class="text-center">After the Marine Corps, Ben said, “I had a hard time readjusting and
                            almost lost my marriage and family due to my issues, but through my newfound faith in Jesus
                            at the time and some counseling, I was able to overcome those issues.” With renewed purpose
                            and drive, he reconciled with his wife and went back to college to earn his AS at Southern
                            Regional Technical College in Thomasville. Georgia and his BS from Abraham Baldwin
                            Agricultural College. He now works as the County GIS Specialist for Jefferson County, and
                            lives in Monticello, Florida. His wife currently works as a dental assistant and is
                            attending college to become a dentist. Together they have three daughters aged 6, 7, and 12.
