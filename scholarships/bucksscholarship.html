                        <h4 class="mb-4 text-center">BIO of Ensign Jerry "Buck" O'Real Pope II </h4>
                        <p class="text-center">James "Jim" Calvin was born in 1952 in Eustis, Florida. The son of an
                            elementary principal, he truly believed that he could convince his first-grade teacher to
                            let him slide because of this connection, but was astounded when his dad held him back. Jim,
                            as his close ones called him, was the youngest of five kids and had an independent spirit
                            that often led to adventures that made you say, "You can't make that up."</p>
                
                        <p class="text-center">Ensign Jerry "Buck" O'Real Pope II was born 2 October 1967. A native of
                            Tallahassee,
                            Florida, he graduated from Leon High School in 1985. After a year of junior college, his
                            competitive
                            spirit, athletic ability, and undying devotion for his country led him to the United States
                            Navy. The
                            Navy assigned him as a fire controlman when he enlisted in 1987. However, intrigued with the
                            history of
                            the Navy SEALs, he actively sought assignment to Basic Underwater Demolition School/SEAL
                            (BUD/S)
                            Training.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">Later that year, Petty Officer Pope received his wish with orders to
                            Coronado,
                            California to attend
                            BUD/S. Unfortunately, only weeks before graduation he suffered from a near fatal training
                            injury.
                            Following recovery and rehabilitation, Petty Officer Pope returned to BUD/S to complete
                            training and
                            graduate with Class 165. After BUD/S he was assigned to an east coast SEAL Team for duty but
                            not long
                            after his arrival he felt his interest lay in medicine and cross-rated to hospital corpsman.
                            As a Navy
                            SEAL qualified hospital corpsman, he deployed multiple times throughout the U.S. Southern
                            command before
                            being transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina to serve as an instructor at the renowned
                            Joint Special
                            Operations Medical Training Center.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">Despite an intense teaching schedule, Petty Officer Pope attended college
                            during his
                            off-hours and within a few years earned a Bachelor of Health Science degree with honors from
                            Campbell
                            University and acceptance to the Department of Defense Intra-Service Physician Assistant
                            (PA) Program.
                            There Officer Candidate Pope continued to maintain his high academic standards graduating
                            February 2001
                            in the upper percentile of his class with a degree from the University of Nebraska and a
                            commission as a
                            medical service corps officer.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">Following PA graduation, Ensign Pope received orders to the Naval Medical
                            Clinic in
                            Quantico, Virginia where he served until August 2002 when he accepted a volunteer assignment
                            to a
                            specified Individual Augmentee program supporting special operations. Ensign Pope was killed
                            in a motor
                            vehicle crash while temporarily assigned to the American Embassy Yemen for ongoing
                            counterterrorism
                            operations on 16 October 2002. He was interned at Arlington National Cemetery on 21 November
                            2002.</p>
                        <p class="text-center">"Buck," as his friends and teammates knew him, was not only the
                            consummate
                            professional within the special operations and medical communities but someone who possessed
                            an uncanny
                            ability to smile during times that would frustrate even the most patient of individuals.
                            Often he would
                            discuss his past misfortunes with a laugh and calming demeanor that would make others wonder
                            how he was
                            able to maintain his personal stamina and sense of humor during some of the most difficult
                            of times. A
                            selfless man, he often volunteered for the worst assignments and gave more than expected. He
                            was a close
                            friend to many, and everyone who knew him misses him.
