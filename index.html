      <p class="text-center">People with disabilities can often enjoy SCUBA diving despite any physical limitations.
        Following medical clearance by your doctor, you will learn to experience diving regardless of your different
        abilities. Water is invigorating and healing...don't let anyone (except your doctor :) tell you that you can't
        dive, too! Dr. Gabrielle K. Gabrielli has been an HSA instructor since 2011 (HSA certification number 4606), and
        she loves working with people with disabilities and helping teach others to do the same in a safe, respectful,
        and fun way.</p>

      <p class="text-center">Gabrielle has been an avid SCUBA diver her entire adult life and has instructor
        certifications with four different agencies! She admits her "SCUBAddiction" and has logged 3,000+ dives in
        Florida and abroad in places like Galapagos, Ecuador, Fiji, Africa, Maldives Philippines, Belize, Roatan,
        Honduras, Bahamas, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Gabrielle enjoys diving in springs and in salt water. She earned her
        instructor certifications with SCUBA Educators International - SEI (former YMCA) and with HSA (Handicapped SCUBA
        Association). Her third instructor certification as a 2-star instructor was with CMAS (Confédération Mondiale
        des Activités Subaquatiques). She is also a Divers Alert Network instructor of many life-saving classes
        including CPR, First Aid, Oxygen Administration, and Neurological Assessment. Gabrielle has many other
        certifications including rescue diver, divemaster, advanced nitrox, scientific diver, cavern, and more.</p>

      <p class="text-center">What sets Gabrielle and SCUBA Educators International apart is the emphasis on education
        and safety. If you are looking to get certified in a weekend, then this is NOT the place for you. If you don't
        mind putting in more time toward learning, homework, and practice, then you will become a safer diver, you will
        have more fun, and the sport will be much more rewarding because you will be able to fully enjoy the relaxation
        that SCUBA diving offers. Gabrielle has a Ph.D. in education, and her specialty is motivation. She loves to help
        people overcome fear and conquer challenges. SCUBA will help improve every other aspect of your life! Gabrielle
        says, "True transformation to leadership begins when people overcome fears and self-limiting beliefs to get out
        of their comfort zones and into their strength zones."</p>
